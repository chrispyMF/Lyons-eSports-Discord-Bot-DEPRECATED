# Lyons-eSports-Discord-Bot
The source code for the LTHS Lyons eSports Bot

This is a passion project for the LTHS eSports club made to broaden my coding horizons with the python language!


Future versions use a file called botAuth which contains a variable called TOKEN, create this file and variable with your token to be able to run this program yourself!
